# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles to âœ¨spice âœ¨ my system up a bit. Not really fleshed out but I'm trying. 

## ðŸ§±Components

- `alacritty` - Trusty terminal
- `nvim` - (Neovim) Text editor. Looking to transition from VSCode

## ðŸ›£ Roadmap

- [ ] installation script
- [ ] rice shell (zsh, fish, etc.)

More to come
